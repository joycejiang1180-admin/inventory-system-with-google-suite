## Day 1: The Spark

### 🎯 Today's Context
- Full workday ahead
- Meetings scheduled  
- Dentist appointment
- Evening workout planned
- **Brain:** Refusing to stop thinking about inventory logic

### 💡 The Origin Story
Yesterday during routine work tasks, the frustration of not knowing what needed restocking sparked the idea. 
A clear mental diagram formed almost immediately. Right after work (4 PM), I sat down and started prototyping in Google Sheets.

### 🛠️ Progress Made
**Prototype Phase:**
- ✅ Basic spreadsheet structure designed
- ✅ Product database schema outlined  
- ✅ Stock level tracking logic drafted
- ✅ Initial dashboard visualization concept

### 🧠 Mental State
Tried to sleep but the excitement was overwhelming. 
That beautiful/horrible state where your brain won't shut off about a problem you're eager to solve. 

### 🎨 Design Decisions
1. **Starting with Google Sheets** - Quickest path to MVP, leverages existing skills
2. **Separate tabs for** - Products, Current Stock, Orders, Dashboard
3. **Color-coding system**
4. **Future-proofing** - Designing with using extern tool in mind

### 🤔 Reflections
> *"Sometimes the best projects come from solving your own immediate problems. The urgency makes you creative, and the personal need ensures you'll actually use what you build."*
> I didn't set any deadline to met, is all because of passion.

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. Implement input tab
2. And whatever idae popup in mind
3. Research, Reaserch, Reaserch!
